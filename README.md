# INTEGRATING-MULTI-MODAL-FUSION-AND-DEEP-LEARNING-BASED-TECHNIQUES-FOR-ENHANCED-OBJECT-DETECTION
â€¢	An Object Detection system developed by combining information from thermal and visible images to improve object detection accuracy.

Libraries Used:
NumPy,
PyWavelets,
OpenCV,
StreamLit,
Cloudflare.

Object Detection Framework:
You Only Look Once version 9 (YOLOv9)

Dataset Used:
LLVIP, a visible-infrared paired dataset for low-light vision. This dataset contains 30976 images, or 15488 pairs, most of which were taken at very dark scenes, and all of the images are strictly aligned in time and space. Pedestrians in the dataset are labeled.
